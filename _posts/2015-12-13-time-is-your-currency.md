You have a new direct message. You click on it to read it. Afterwards you find yourself wandering around the rest of the website, looking at the latest posts.

You have a new email. Your friends have shared some content that might be of interest to you. You click on it to go to the website and read it. The link opens in a pop-up window that ensures you're back on the same site when you're done. You scroll through the latest news after closing it. You forgot what you were doing ten minutes previously.

Notifications can become exceptionally overwhelming if we don't keep them under control. Websites are fighting for our time because, quite simply, our time is what we pay with to use these services for free. The longer you linger, the more likely you are to see advertisements. The more you engage and reveal your browsing patterns, the more likely you are to get better adverts tailored to you.

When you sit in a quiet room on your own, what do you reach for? When you reach for it, what do you do on it? Are you mindfully partaking in this activity? Try and think critically about the steps that you are taking, considering whether you wanted to do this, or whether you are just going through subconscious motions.

The ability to focus on a small amount of worthwhile things is what makes the difference in your lifetime to come. It's OK to ignore that email until later. If you want to see the content that your friends are sharing, do so because you have chosen to.

I fought hard with overwhelm in the last few years. Now I try my best to batch up my communication, where possible, into a couple of short discrete blocks a day. I've turned off most of the notifications on my phone. I try to close Slack when I don't need to communicate anything. I try to only keep one or two browser tabs open at work. I try my best to do one thing at a time. 

Between all of these distractions you can find a surprising amount of spaciousness. It's a healthy venue for breeze to blow over the brain.

Where was I?
