I'm sure that you've seen a film, a TV show or a cartoon where the teacher turns to the class and asks a question, only to see that no child in the class raises their hand. At that moment, the teacher singles out one of the children and puts her on the spot.

"So Suzie, what's the answer?"

"I don't know, Miss", the girl replies, blushing.

The rest of the class titter at her misfortune, and the fact that they've not been chosen themselves. Not knowing things in school could be cruel.

With technology, not knowing is an admirable thing. It means that the person has had the honesty to admit that they need to learn more. It can be the start of mentorship, where a more senior member of staff can have a constructive pairing session. It can be the beginning of an honest conversation where nobody knows the answer and they can begin to find out new things together. It's a great thing.

Conversely, pretending that you know the answers is harmful. It can set others off down the wrong path and it can teach bad habits. Be proud of not knowing, because it's a wonderful opportunity to discover new things.
