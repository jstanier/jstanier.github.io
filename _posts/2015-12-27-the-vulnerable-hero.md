The latest Star Wars film, aside from being generally excellent, is a strong parable in leadership. Rey and Finn show the characteristics of the most likable movie heroes: a strong will to do what's right, courage in difficult situations, and a transparent vulnerability in the face of danger. These are characters that we can clearly relate to, and rally support for, in the face of overwhelming circumstances.

Back in the real world, I've seen managers and leaders who are afraid to show that vulnerability.  It is hidden under the pretence that, if revealed, it will be exposed as a weakness. However, this really isn't true. A lack of vulnerability is cold, hard to judge and, fundamentally, isn't human. I would much rather interact with those who are open about their challenges and difficulties, because we can then share our fears and overcome them together, as humans do so well in great tales from fiction and non-fiction. 

I've found remaining vulnerable challenging though, especially when moving into more senior roles: people are looking to you for the answers in challenging personal situations, or during large, tricky projects. If you're worried as well, your team might not get the answer they expect. But think of the opposite of not remaining openly vulnerable: not exposing it is, at its essence, deception. Being open about our vulnerabilities enables the growth of trust; it's the pinky promise at the edge of the cliff. Let's be vulnerable together.
