title: Not knowing
---

I'm sure that you've seen either a film, a TV show or a cartoon where the teacher turns to the class and asks a question, only to see that no child raises their hand. At that moment, the teacher singles out one of the children and puts them on the spot.

"Suzie, what's the answer?"

"I don't know, Miss", the girl replies, blushing.

The rest of the class proceed to titter at her misfortune, relieved at the fact that they've not been chosen themselves. Not knowing things in school could be cruel and humiliating.

With technology, not knowing is an admirable thing. It means that the person has had the honesty to admit that they need to learn more. It can be the start of a mentorship, where a more experienced engineer can have a constructive pairing session. It can be the beginning of an honest conversation where, in fact, nobody knows the answer and people can begin to find out new things together. It's opportunity.

Conversely, pretending that you know the answers is harmful. It can set others off wandering down the wrong path and it can teach bad habits. Be proud of not knowing, because it's a wonderful time to discover new things.
