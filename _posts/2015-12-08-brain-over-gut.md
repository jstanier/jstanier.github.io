title: Brain over gut
---

There are a number of situations in life where it's important to trust our gut instincts as well as our brain. I can think of a few: who to love, where to live and deciding our life's purpose. However, technology is not a place for gut instincts to be involved.

You may be incredibly passionate about an open source project, an operating system or a complex distributed memory store. That's wonderful that you are, because you will be passionate at working with it and maintaining the software we build with it. But when it comes to choosing a technology to solve a problem with, there is only one thing that matters: data. How fast is it? How does it scale? What are the gnarly corners that we need to know about? These are the nightmares that we're all going to deal with in the years to come, so it's important that we rely on data to make choices.

It's not easy to do this, but it's important. The 3AM pagers of the future could be buzzing if decisions aren't made with facts. Leave the emotion at the door.
