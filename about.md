I'm (Dr.) James. I'm currently VP Engineering at [Brandwatch](http://www.brandwatch.com). I also enjoy a great number of things that many other people on this planet also partake in, such as cycling, reading, playing music, and inventing bad puns.

Right now I'm focussed on:

* Growing the Brandwatch Engineering department and learning as much as I can whilst doing so
* Helping run and sponsor [Brighton Java](http://www.meetup.com/Brighton-Java/)
* Improving the quality of what I read and write
* Finding more balance in my life by not constantly being sat in front of the computer
* Enjoying the present moment, rather than relentlessly projecting into the future.

If you'd like to get in touch, I'm [@jstanier](http://www.twitter.com/jstanier). Do say hello!
